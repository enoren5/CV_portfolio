# Yoseph Portfolio
PURPOSE + "DIRECTIVE" + CONTENT VISION for this site = effectively "abstracts" for book length and long form essay material I've written providing overviews of political polemics, hermetic tarot card literary analysis, analytical philosophy, extracting market insights from financial data, and software engineering endeavours in general. I begin with a summary of my LinkedIn profile and where I am at in my career in banking today.
- Above = beginnings of ABOUT 
- Previoos OKC "business card" opening with emojis= PREAMBLE 

### TO DO:

- Hire freelancer on Fiverr to complete `gateway` web app.  *** Only once `gateway` is locked and contents are protected will I make the production environment LIVE. Once production environemtn is secured from web crawlers and doxx operations, it will be "safe" to share tarot website and self hypnosis site with usernames and passwords
- Set up unique `/admin` address to reduce major attack vector
- Jupyter Notebooks to showcase the following!
  1. Machine Learning:
      - PCA
      - credit cards
      - olga
  2. Algorithms design
     - Talk throug my process: Watch visual flow chart, read pseudo code, watch Javascript solution, and then implement in Python
  3. aTimeLogger

- Write up content, for 'premable' introduce myself and my career, and maybe a new early section, use the opportunity to fill in gaps not included in LinkedIn as I casually put the subsequent workplace testimonials in context 
- Animated carousel of testimonials from LinkedIn with more recommendations from coworkers and Consultants (x2?)
- Create new templates for Jupyter Notebook embeds with Catppucin color palette
- Tailwind Catppucin color schem for rest of CSS of website
- Setup custom email DNS addresses through Protonmail (In January?)
- Leverage elegant and smooth JS/TS animations from Brad Traversery
- Default unordered list bullet points are boring. Find something more interesting
- Create new carousel showcasing top 5 best #VeganMealTime 
- for book list content, leverage existing reviews from IG like Naomi Klein, David Speigalhalter, and Frances Yates
- THIS WHOLE WEBSITE is like the ULTIMATE form of self expression. Think of it like OkC except its' dynamic. In the preamble and throughout, use emoji's liberally just like on OKC. Take OKC's "Business card" former segment and ask ChatGPT to re-write it as if "Boheme".
- This site is turning into something like that "Olde Fashioned" "WHO AM I?" essay from summit ministry where I get to showcase everythin that has happened since, realizing my potential.
- Consider adding section "On Charity" where I promote helen keller in writing, without the pressure of committing anything to memory. There is no word count limitation of 600-800 words for TM speech. If I need to write 2,000 words, so be it!
- Consider clarifying:
    - Professional Socials: GitHub, LinkedIn, SO
    
    vs:
    - Personal Socials like: IG, FB


***  Once all of the above is complete and my identity as Enneatype 4 has been expressed to it's fullest, I can focus on learning more algorithms so I can ultimately understand Nix Enneatype 5.
